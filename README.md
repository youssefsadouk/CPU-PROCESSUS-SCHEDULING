## CPU Scheduling Algorithms Implementation and simulation Using Qt Framework

This is a project that demonstrates the implementation of several CPU scheduling algorithms using the Qt framework of C++. The algorithms implemented in this project include:

    First Come First Serve (FCFS)
    Shortest Job First (SJF)
    Priority Scheduling
    Round Robin (RR)

This project can be used as a reference for understanding how CPU scheduling algorithms work and how they can be implemented using the Qt framework of C++. It also serves as an educational resource for students and developers who want to learn more about CPU scheduling algorithms.
# Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following software installed:

    Qt 5.0 or later
    C++ compiler (e.g. gcc)

# Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your_username/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.git

Then open the project in Qt Creator and build it.
# How to Use

Once the project is built, you can run the executable file to launch the CPU scheduling simulator. The simulator allows you to simulate different CPU scheduling algorithms by entering the process details (arrival time, burst time, priority) and setting the time quantum for the Round Robin algorithm. The simulator will then display the Gantt chart and calculate the waiting time, turnaround time, and average waiting time for the processes.
